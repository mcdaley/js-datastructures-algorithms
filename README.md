# JavaScript Datastructures and Algorithms
Collection of datastructures and algorithms implemented in JavaScript.

## Datastructures

### Stacks

### Queues
A **queue** is an ordered collection of items that follows the **first in, first out (FIFO)** principle. The addition of new elements in a queue is at the tail, and the removal is from the front. The newest element added to the queue must wait at the end of the queue.

Project contains two implementation of a queue, one using an array and another using  javascript object to store the collection of elements. Also, added a **deque** datastructure that allows elements to be added/removed from the front and back of the queue.

### Linked Lists
A **linked list** store a sequential collection of elements, but unlike arrays, in linked lists the elements are not placed contiguously in memory. Each element consists of a node that stores the element and a reference (i.e., link or pointer) that points to the next element.

### Linked List

### Double Linked List

## Sets
A **set** is a collection of items that are unordered and consists of unique elements. This data structures uses the same mathematical concept as finite sets, but it is applied to a computer science data structure.

Sets also have some basic operations, such as union, intersection, and difference.

## Hashes

### Dictionary

### Hash Table

## Algorithms
