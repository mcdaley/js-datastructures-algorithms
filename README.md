# JavaScript Datastructures and Algorithms
Collection of datastructures and algorithms implemented in JavaScript.

## Datastructures

### Stacks

### Queues
A **queue** is an ordered collection of items that follows the **first in, first out (FIFO)** principle. The addition of new elements in a queue is at the tail, and the removal is from the front. The newest element added to the queue must wait at the end of the queue.
